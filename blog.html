            <h3>1. Difference between the local storage and session storage.</h3>
            <p>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the
                data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes
                the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date</p>

            <h3>Difference between the block scope and global scope.</h3>
            <p><b>Block scope means local scope. Defference are:</b> JavaScript variables have only two scopes. <br>
                <b>Global Variables - </b> A global variable has a global scope which means it can be
                defined anywhere in your JavaScript code. <br> <b>Local Variables - </b> A local variable will be
                visible only within a function
                where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

            <h3>How work event loop?</h3>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the
                Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
                effectively runs it. Such
                an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

            <h3>How we get undefine?</h3>
            <p>Undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no
                value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
                <br>
                <b>Some scenarios of undefine is:</b>
                Uninitialized variable, Accessing a non-existing property, Function parameters, Function return value,
                void operator
